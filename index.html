	<h3>Hey! Check out my face! I hope you enjoy looking at it!</h3>
	<p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
	On the playground was where I spent most of my days
	Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
	And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
	When a couple of guys who were up to no good
	Started making trouble in my neighborhood
	I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
	She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</p>
